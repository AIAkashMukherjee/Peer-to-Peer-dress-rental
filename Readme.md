# Peer to peer dress rental prices


## About Dataset

This data set was gathered from a peer-to-peer lending platform based in the UK. It covers every dress listed on the platform at the time of collection, just under 30,000 listings.

For each dress, it's listing name, brand, colour and price for rental are provided, along with some additional categorical labels applied by the platform.

The initial idea behind this data set was to use it to assist my girlfriend in pricing her dresses using regression models, though there are plenty of other interesting things to explore.
